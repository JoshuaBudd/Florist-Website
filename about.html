		<h1>The Story of Flowers R Us</h1>
		<img src="colorfullFlowers.jpg" class="imageRight" alt="Rows of Colorfull Flowers" width="220" height="170">
		<p>Flowers R Us was first founded by John Keenan in 1996 in Savanna, Georgia. John always loved the moments
		   he spent with his mother in the garden, tending to the tulips and roses. When he turned 18, he set out to 
		   open his own florist shop and live his dream. John bought a tiny shop, conditioned the backyard of it, and 
		   began to shape his dream of growing the best flowers he could. People came to see the amount of effort
		   went into these flowers, and so his business began to grow. Before he knew it, he had hired 3 workers to help
		   around the garden and shop. With the help of these new employees and John's family, the business had nowhere 
           go but up. While John would be in the garden, tending to his flowers or making an order for someone, his wife would be
           handling the storefront. By this time, John had married his High-School sweetheart, Jessica. They both worked hard with their
           new employees to grow the business. John's business was doing pretty good for itself, but John new that if he could
		   make his products accessible to more people, it would help his company that he loved more. So, with this in 
           mind, he decided to contract someone out to make a website for his business. With the launch of Flowers R Us'
		   website, it marks a significant stride in Mr. Keenan's beloved business. The ability to reach a broader pool of
		   potential customers and a way for them to purchase products from out of state didn't just bring his business into
		   the 21<sup>st</sup> century, it catapulted it into the foreground of websites that offer breath-taking arrangements
		   and products to grow your own magnificent flowers!</p>
